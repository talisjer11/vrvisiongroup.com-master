Everything just works better when every employee knows what they\u2019re doing, how they\u2019re doing it and how it relates to the bigger picture \u2013 and it helps if you\u2019ve been able to run employees through any emergency situations before they\u2019ve actually happened on the floor.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual reality can change the face of manufacturing training, and it has the potential to make the entire process better, cheaper and easier to access; in turn, this can better the entire manufacturing industry if it\u2019s given enough time.<\/p>\n<p>While most people think they have a pretty good idea of what it is that virtual reality can do, there\u2019s a lot more potential locked up in VR than you might have ever realized before.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s more about the use of virtual reality for manufacturing training, and just how it can make things easier for you and your employees when it comes to training.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why virtual reality? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It gives you all the benefits of reality without the associated cost or danger that might come with a trip to the plant in order to achieve the same goal.<\/p>\n<p>Training can interrupt working operations, too, and a virtual reality environment carries the benefit that it can continue in an environment separate from the actual plant itself, while you can still experience everything you would have in the physical plant \u2013 and without having to go there.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s cheaper, better and faster than most conventional forms of training \u2013 and that\u2019s not all. There are plenty more benefits to why people should be switching to virtual reality solutions for their training needs instead.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Danger &amp; Harm Reduction<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Virtual reality can see a drastic decrease in the amount of possible danger during the training phase.<\/p>\n<p>First, virtual reality allows you to put your staff in situations that they never would have seen in a real environment save for the time where an emergency takes place. For training purposes, people can be taught how to react in dangerous situations without having to be exposed to the danger themselves. This includes disaster management and emergency training, and the danger reduction during the training phase also means that any physical work at the plant will likely be safer too due to the adequate training having been provided.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Environmental Adaptation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you wanted to \u201cmake something happen\u201d for the purposes of a demonstration, there are many things that you\u2019ll just have to wait for to happen \u2013 or you\u2019ll end up telling employees-in-training a theoretical idea of what could happen instead of being able to show them the demonstration at all. This is one of the main physical limitations for teaching in a real-life environment \u2013 and it can be quickly dealt with if you were to switch over to a virtually-aided training setting.<\/p>\n<p>In a virtual setting, any changes to the environment can be made with just a few clicks \u2013 and any situations can be triggered in the same way. Then, people can be led through the \u201ctheoretical\u201d situation while they\u2019re still able to physically see what\u2019s going on.<\/p>\n<p>People are naturally visual, and VR is the perfect way to provide an all-round training solution. Show, don\u2019t just tell.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Cost of Manufacturing Training<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Manufacturing training in real life doesn\u2019t just carry the very real danger of injury if someone were to screw up on the floor, it\u2019s also pretty expensive even when it\u2019s done right. Training has the potential to cost your company thousands per year, and there\u2019s no real way to make training \u201ccheaper\u201d if you think about it: While you could hire cheaper training solutions, there are a thousand different reasons (including safety!) why you shouldn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual reality can make the entire training phase cheaper, and you don\u2019t have to worry about the fact that you might be cutting corners somewhere, because the virtual reality training experience can often turn out to be <em>better<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also true that a virtual environment matching your factory usually only has to be built once, and can be used for several training phases that match the situation the environment has been built for, whereas training would often require new training consultants every time \u2013 and this can add up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Customized Solutions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When it comes to in-person training, it can often be impersonal \u2013 and this is a great part of why people say that training courses don\u2019t stick in their heads enough. If we\u2019re talking about the safety of your manufacturing plant, this can be obviously pretty dangerous when people don\u2019t remember vital information in the face of an emergency.<\/p>\n<p>One of the great things of using virtual reality is the fact that you have access to customized solutions \u2013 solutions that can allow you to showcase almost any theoretical situation in a training environment. This means that, during and after training, the people trained are much more prepared to deal with these possible situations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Excitement of Virtual Reality <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nobody likes the sound of having to \u201cattend a training day\u201d &#8211; hell, most of the time nobody even likes the sound of having to \u201clearn something.\u201d So why call it that?<\/p>\n<p>A virtual training session can seem a lot more exciting than your average training day. It\u2019s cool, it\u2019s futuristic, and it can ensure that the information that\u2019s given during the training phase sticks just because it seems like something really, really cool at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the cool-factor of virtual reality is rarely the reason you\u2019re incorporating it into the program \u2013 but that\u2019s not the point, and virtual reality can give company training a considerable boost in the right direction.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>VR Leads New Possibilities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What virtual reality can mean for you and your business doesn\u2019t end here: It\u2019s great for more than just training, it also happens to be great for new possibilities when it comes to research \u2013 and virtual reality is well-known for powering never-before-seen innovation within the work and research environments because of the fact that it allows you to experiment far more than a real environment ever would.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox\" data-provider=\"facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vrvisioninc\/\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"Facebook\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/facebook.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-twitter nolightbox\" data-provider=\"twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/vrvisioninc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"twitter\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/twitter.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-linkedin nolightbox\" data-provider=\"linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/ca.linkedin.com\/company\/vr-vision-inc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"linkedin\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/linkedin.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-youtube nolightbox\" data-provider=\"youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" href=\"https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/channel\/UCc9hEJyEemiJe9DIOjBquhw\/videos\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px\"><img alt=\"youtube\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/youtube.png\" \/><\/a>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Manufacturing training is essential if you want your manufacturing plant to be run like a well-oiled machine.
