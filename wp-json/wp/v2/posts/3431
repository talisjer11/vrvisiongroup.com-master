Healthcare &amp; Medical<\/h3>\n<p>This may seem obvious but the healthcare industry has already started making huge advancements in virtual reality for training.\u00a0 Healthcare specialists are exploring ways in which practitioners can practice complex operations in virtual simulated environments in order to heal patients and save lives.\u00a0 There have been many advancements in just the past year as were discussed at the <a href=\"http:\/\/health.vrvoice.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">VR &amp; Healthcare Symposium<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>A startup in London called FundamentalVR is doing just this as they create simulated surgical environments for doctors to test out various methods and to hone their craft before exacting precision movements in the real world.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3436\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3436\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-3436 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/vr-surgery-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"vr-surgury\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/vr-surgery-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/vr-surgery-800x533-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/vr-surgery-800x533-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/vr-surgery-800x533-338x225.jpg 338w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/vr-surgery-800x533-400x267.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-3436\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><small>Image from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fundamentalvr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">FundamentalVR<\/a><\/small><\/p><\/div>\n<p>In the world of hospitals, VR technology firm MPathic is being used to train medical students on how to break bad news to patients and their families.\u00a0 Students are <a href=\"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2017\/05\/12\/mpathic-vr-doctor-patient-conversations\/?utm_campaign=elearningindustry.com&amp;utm_source=%2Fusing-virtual-reality-to-train-employees-4-industries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">learning empathetic ways<\/a> to deal with hard to bear situations that are stressful at an early stage.\u00a0 Learning empathy and how to handle various scenarios makes them much more ready to handle real-world objections.<\/p>\n<p>Another prime example is with Case Western University which has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/how-vr-could-give-trainee-doctors-the-feel-of-real-surgery\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">completely done away with operating simulations<\/a> on cadavers and is instead turning to Microsoft Hololens in order to simulate surgeries and allow prospective doctors to easily look at all layers of the human body in a virtual environment.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Construction<\/h3>\n<p>The construction industry has been completely flipped on its head with various Worksite VR simulators now readily available for training employees on CAT equipment as well as crane operations.\u00a0 These simulations allow potential workers to learn the ropes on an engaging VR platform before heading into the real world in which mistakes can be costly and harmful.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3435\" style=\"width: 785px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3435\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-3435 \" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Worksitevr_Simulator-Digging-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Worksite-VR\" width=\"775\" height=\"436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Worksitevr_Simulator-Digging-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Worksitevr_Simulator-Digging-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Worksitevr_Simulator-Digging-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Worksitevr_Simulator-Digging-400x225.jpg 400w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Worksitevr_Simulator-Digging.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-3435\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><small>Image from: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worksitevr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">WorksiteVR.com<\/a><\/small><\/p><\/div>\n<p>Another area of training is in harm reduction handling not only dangerous equipment but dangerous materials as well.\u00a0 Overall 6.5 million people work on construction sites every day, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.osha.gov\/Publications\/OSHA3252\/3252.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">fatality rate is higher<\/a> in this field than any other industry.\u00a0 Having safety and procedural training can help lower the risk factor as well as prepare employees better for the risks that they may face in the field.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Retail<\/h3>\n<p>The retail sector is adopting VR in very creative ways, the most noticeable is that it is being used for data analytics and research for store layouts.\u00a0 This is something <a href=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/virtual-reality-for-retail-market-research-is-it-viable\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we discussed previously<\/a>, but it has started to take shape and actually be utilized by brands to create &#8220;dark stores&#8221; in which they can test layouts and buyer intent in order to optimize storefronts and increase revenues.<\/p>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3434 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/dassault.jpg\" alt=\"dark-store-vr\" width=\"1366\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/dassault.jpg 1366w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/dassault-300x127.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/dassault-768x324.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/dassault-1024x432.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/dassault-437x184.jpg 437w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/dassault-400x169.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" \/>\n<p>Another company utilizing VR in the retail sector is STRIVR, which is working with Walmart to train its employees in management and customer service.\u00a0 Staff are being trained with an Oculus Rift and are being made to follow on-screen cues on how to deal with disgruntled customers and other various customer service related scenarios.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Hospitality<\/h3>\n<p>Other common industries like hospitality are starting to adapt to Virtual Reality in order to simulate scenarios for their stores and workers alike.\u00a0 Here is VR Vision we are <a href=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/virtual-reality-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">working on a VR development prototype<\/a> for Hero Burger that would simulate a user inside a store and allow them to interact with various elements in an entertaining scenario while also providing context for learning and training.<\/p>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3300 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/3Demonstrate-Your-Products.jpg\" alt=\"vr-development\" width=\"651\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/3Demonstrate-Your-Products.jpg 651w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/3Demonstrate-Your-Products-300x162.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/3Demonstrate-Your-Products-416x225.jpg 416w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/3Demonstrate-Your-Products-400x216.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px\" \/>\n<p>Another fast-food chain that has adopted VR is Honeygrow.\u00a0 They are using VR to train employees on a 360-video walkthrough of the Honeygrow locations while the employees listen to company values and training tips from the Founder and CEO of the company.<\/p>\n<p><iframe title=\"honeygrow VR training preview\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/G63_a6KckNM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Having over 17 locations across North America adds a personality to the training and gives the employees a sense that they are connected all the way to the top of the company.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Aerospace<\/h3>\n<p>One of the earliest adopters of VR was NASA.\u00a0 They have been using VR since its onset in order to train astronauts on a wide array of scenarios that they need to be up to speed on in order to go to space.\u00a0 With VR they are simulating zero-G environments, as well as the aspect of spacewalking.\u00a0 Both require precision movements and the ability to train in a risk-free environment offers a way to prepare the would-be astronauts like never before.<\/p>\n<p>Another development with NASA&#8217;s VR training labs includes some collaboration with Microsoft in which they are utilizing the HoloLens to simplify communications between both ground staff and astronauts.\u00a0 This gives the astronauts a way to have holographic technology overlaying instructions in real-time while also employing face-to-face communication and interactive workflow that engages the astronauts like never before.<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up<\/h3>\n<p>As you can see there a multitude of uses across a vast array of markets for Virtual Reality.\u00a0 We predict this trend to continue to grow in the coming years as technology comes down in price and increases in availability.\u00a0 Virtual Reality can reduce harm and risk and that makes it a no-brainer as a useful tool for training employees in scenarios that in the past were dangerous and costly for mistakes to happen.\u00a0 \u00a0Take a good look at these 5 examples and think about how VR training could be implemented into your employee development programs.<\/p>\n<a class=\"synved-social-button
