which then leads to the ability to train more people faster and at scale.\u00a0 This foundation for training allows for integration across multiple functions in the enterprise, which will lead to much more technical training success as users can replay scenarios without fail as many times as needed to harness the material.<\/p>\n<p>VR has the potential to take many industries to the next level by changing the way employers onboard new employees for technical training roles, where senior instructors may not be readily available.\u00a0 \u00a0Overall this creates increased retention and allows for faster learning through exposure than ever before.\u00a0 The ability to replay recorded sessions at length gives learners a new way to learn &#8211; by doing, as many times as necessary to become confident before leaving the proverbial metaverse.\u00a0 These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZP7QV1GmagE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">immersive 1-to-1 environments<\/a> will many times mimic the real world, so the dilution from the virtual world to the real one becomes less of an issue.<\/p>\n<p>This leads to a dramatic cut in costs for training and onboarding employees.\u00a0 Not only does this save time and money for employers, but it also saves time for the employee, giving them a unique way to learn material that has previously never been available.\u00a0 This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yi_mVMSe_W0\">increases not only ROI<\/a> but also cuts back on space requirements that were previously required for training dojos.\u00a0 While ROI increases, insurance premiums get lowered and the savings start to add up tremendously.\u00a0 This not only impacts the bottom line but is also helping with overall travel expenses for corporations as many times learners can have a VR headset sent to them wherever they are located which leads to not only savings but less of an impact on their environmental footprint.<\/p>\n<p>While the benefits are seemingly endless, VR training still does have its challenges.\u00a0 With true VR adoption, there are definitely <a href=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/vr-ar-application-development-costs-explained\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">costs of software development<\/a> and hardware to be considered, especially at scale. One of the biggest hurdles to VR adoption is the lack of understanding of the technology in the market today.\u00a0 The use cases are scarce and it&#8217;s hard for brands to envision the benefits without seeing what someone else has already done in their sector.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s not forget that just over a decade ago this technology didn&#8217;t exist &#8212; or was extremely bulky and hard to manage.\u00a0 Although, the way the hardware is evolving it will only be a matter of time for adoption to hit the mainstream.\u00a0 I expect to see more adoption in our post-pandemic world as any tools that can make learning more enjoyable and make travel less of a requirement will increase user acceptance.<\/p>\n<a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48
