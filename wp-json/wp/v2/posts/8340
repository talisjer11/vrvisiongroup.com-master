Each new generation of VR gear will add more to the experience, but presently, the Oculus Quest 2 has a wide variety of applications. The new generation of Oculus Quest devices was developed not only with video games in mind but businesses as well.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oculus Quest 2 for Business Needs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the dynamic economies of the 21st century, businesses are always looking for ways to create a more efficient and effective workplace. Oculus Quest 2 can help by providing realistic scenarios to better train workers. Some of the training exercises taking place on the Oculus Quest 2 include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Customer Service:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Training employees to interact with customers who have varying needs. Workplaces that could benefit from customer service enterprise training with VR includes restaurants, sales teams, or the hospitality industry.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Technical Skill Training: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Training that keeps employees up to date about current innovations in their field. Enterprise training with VR can help by allowing employees to learn from mistakes that won\u2019t negatively affect the organization.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Quality Training: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality training is vital for production-focused corporations. It trains employees to competently and consistently find quality control errors and alleviate them. VR for enterprise training can be useful for production-based organizations because a VR system would remove the need for on-site training, and therefore, errors in work.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Safety Training: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safety training is among the most important forms of training an organization will provide. Keeping employees safe and productive will create more efficiency in the long run. Enterprise training with VR is a significant development for safety training because it allows employers to provide a safe learning environment for problems that may arise in the workplace. Prepared employees are safe employees.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Case Studies of Oculus Quest 2 Success in Enterprise Training<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VR for enterprise training has only been growing, and with the release of the Oculus Quest 2, the market will be expanding again. Corporations usually hire a developer to create scenarios unique to the challenges facing the company. Many large corporations have already integrated VR technology into their training, and in doing so, they have created greater efficiency and effectiveness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nestl\u00e9 Purina<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As one of the leading pet food providers globally, Nestl\u00e9 Purina continually needs to look for ways to create efficiency. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/business.oculus.com\/case-studies\/nestle\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using VR for enterprise training<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was one fundamental way Nestl\u00e9 Purina could increase their efficiency, especially in their sales department.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to high travel costs and loss of productivity, it was hard for Nestl\u00e9 Purina to show their sales staff how, where, and with what quality their product was made. Nestl\u00e9 Purina used the Oculus Quest 2 to create a 360-degree tour of their production facility to solve this problem. The 360-degree tours allowed salespeople to see the facility without the need for costly and time-wasting travel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another critical use of the Oculus Quest 2 for Nestl\u00e9 Purina concerned merchandising. Where a product is placed on a shelf determines its visibility to consumers. With the Oculus Quest 2, the sales team at Nestl\u00e9 Purina has been able to virtually determine placement by analyzing sales data. By determining placement virtually, a salesperson can better plan for consumption changes at individual retailers and save time on travel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nestl\u00e9 Purina estimates that they save more than $100,000 per year since they have implemented enterprise training with VR through Oculus Quest 2. By saving money and time, a company like Nestl\u00e9 Purina can garner more significant profits.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hilton<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/business.oculus.com\/case-studies\/hilton\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hilton uses VR for enterprise training<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in two main ways. First, they noticed that many of their corporate staff had never worked in a hotel before. Corporate management not having experience created problems because, in some cases, management would implement innovations that caused more disturbances than they solved. Hilton responded by deploying the Oculus Quest 2 to train their corporate staff in their front-line workers\u2019 experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-8341\" title=\"hilton-vr\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/hilton-vr-300x203.jpg\" alt=\"hilton-vr\" width=\"450\" height=\"304\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/hilton-vr-300x203.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/hilton-vr-960x648.jpg 960w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/hilton-vr-768x519.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/hilton-vr-333x225.jpg 333w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/hilton-vr-400x270.jpg 400w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/hilton-vr.jpg 998w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By showing corporate staff the experiences of their front line workers, Hilton was better able to create innovations that aid their company\u2019s efficiency. Having corporate staff and front line workers on the same page will create a more harmonious work environment for all.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hilton also used the Oculus Quest 2 to develop scenarios where their employees were customers in either good or harmful interactions with hotel staff. By putting employees in the shoes of their customers, the hotel was able to explain precisely how hotel staff should respond to customer requests. Enterprise training with VR allows companies such as Hilton to train their employees for all types of customer interaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hilton has seen significant success with the implementation of an enterprise training program with virtual reality. They have seen time spent on training reduced by more than 91%, and employees who received the training changed their behaviour in 87% of cases where corrections were needed. As a hospitality-based company, customer interactions are of utmost importance to Hilton.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson &amp; Johnson Institute<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/business.oculus.com\/case-studies\/johnson-and-johnson\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Johnson &amp; Johnson Institute<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has uncovered what they believe to be a massive problem in the medical field, which could be solved with the implementation of enterprise training with VR.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson &amp; Johnson noticed that new tools and operations were routinely being developed in the medical industry, but medical professionals could never use these innovations without training. When it comes to surgery, training is more important than anything.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Realizing there was a dire need for new training tools, the Johnson &amp; Johnson Institute helped develop programs for the Oculus Quest 2 that trained surgeons in new techniques and tool usage. By developing VR solutions, companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson can promote training without patient safety issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s development of enterprise training with VR has resulted in a few advantages for the company. They can now train medical professionals with the latest technology in their field while eliminating safety issues almost entirely. Johnson &amp; Johnson also credits the Oculus Quest 2 for allowing remote meetings to feel more human, a problem that has arisen due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UConn Health<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The University of Connecticut\u2019s Health division is an industry<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/business.oculus.com\/case-studies\/uconn-health\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leader in using VR training<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for its medical staff. By integrating enterprise training with VR into their organization, Uconn Health has increased the amount of training provided to each medical professional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctors gain skills by practicing and refining the capabilities they learned in school or in their residency. The problem that Uconn Health found was that their training time and opportunities were limited. By expanding training to the Oculus Quest 2, Uconn Health was able to add additional training capabilities by allowing some practice procedures to take place virtually.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uconn Health has also added software to their training that allows medical professionals to make mistakes. The software will analyze the mistake and give guidance on how to proceed better next time. The software in use at Uconn Health also gives the instructors access to the virtual surgeries to give feedback. All of these innovations have led to more opportunities for doctors to practice and hone their abilities,<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avangrid Renewables<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/business.oculus.com\/case-studies\/avangrid\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avangrid Renewables<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> operates more than 60 wind-powered energy production facilities across the United States.
