Still, if you clicked on this to figure out what the acronyms mean, AR stands for Augmented Reality, and NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. Can these two things work together? Let&#8217;s find out.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unique collecting has hit the digital market. NFTs are one of the hottest trends on the internet right now. Everyone is talking about them. Most likely because certain NFTs are selling at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/3\/1\/22308075\/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">auction<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> recently for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ftw.usatoday.com\/2021\/02\/nba-top-shot-lebron-james-dunk-sold-record-price\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hundreds of thousands of dollars<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These sales can be exciting, but they can also be confusing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One logical question is, can, Augmented Reality be used with the new hot trend of the NFT to create a new online collecting experience? It&#8217;s a good question and one that bears examining further.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div align=\"center\">A recent NFT that sold for 10 ETH (over $17k)<br \/>\n<div style=\"width: 640px;\" class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');<\/script><![endif]-->\n<video class=\"wp-video-shortcode\" id=\"video-8522-1\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" preload=\"metadata\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"video\/mp4\" src=\"https:\/\/ipfs.pixura.io\/ipfs\/QmQGCuMMG55a8t1jSnZhVes1a1LfZUsvZGxcKAySsvYXBh\/MastermindNFT.mp4?_=1\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/ipfs.pixura.io\/ipfs\/QmQGCuMMG55a8t1jSnZhVes1a1LfZUsvZGxcKAySsvYXBh\/MastermindNFT.mp4\">https:\/\/ipfs.pixura.io\/ipfs\/QmQGCuMMG55a8t1jSnZhVes1a1LfZUsvZGxcKAySsvYXBh\/MastermindNFT.mp4<\/a><\/video><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\nWhat Is NFT?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand NFT, you first have to understand what fungible means. Fungible is a good that can be replaced by another identical good or a commodity of equal value. For example, a gold bar is fungible for another gold bar of the same weight and purity. It is also fungible for a more significant amount of silver.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-Fungible means that the item is unique and can&#8217;t be traded for precisely the same value. Examples would be items like original artwork, game-used sports gear, and autographed memorabilia. These are one-of-a-kind items you don&#8217;t see everywhere.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-Fungible Tokens are a piece of code in a blockchain overlaid or applied to a specific image, program, or code. The information is stored in a database that says that you own the item.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These can be placed on works of art, unique items or characters in games, and almost every other kind of digital thing you can imagine. Having an NFT is the equivalent of getting an original piece of art as opposed to a print.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can purchase Starry Night&#8217;s print for 2 dollars on amazon, but the original is a priceless piece of art. NFT denotes the digital difference between a print and a unique collectible online.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Does AR Work With NFT?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Games offer many bundles and packages to buy characters, items, armor, and boosts. People spend thousands of dollars a year purchasing these items to make their games better. Right now, there is no limit on how many people can have the same item.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you play the AR game Pokemon Go, rare Pokemon are hard to get. You can spend money on specific items and boosts. Tomorrow there could be an update to the game that makes your prized Shiny Party Hat Nidorino as common as a Pidgey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Pokeman started adding Augmented Reality NFT, you could have a unique Pokemon that is only yours. It would be your Pokemon, and another just like it could never exist. Sure there may be others that looked like it, but it wouldn&#8217;t be the same character.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR can start doing this with many features. Soon your characters and every character in the game could have specialized armor, gear, and decorations that make your gameplay individualized for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collectors Mentality<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are probably some people reading the description of Augmented Reality NFT and thinking that no one would pay a premium for this. What they aren&#8217;t taking into account is the collectors&#8217; mentality.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Contemporary artist Krista Kim\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/superrare.co\/artwork-v2\/mars-house-21383\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently sold<\/a>\u00a0an NFT-minted digital house for 288\u00a0ether, valued at over $500,000 based on the\u00a0cryptocurrency\u2019s trading price.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 750px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" title=\"Mars House AR NFT\" src=\"https:\/\/image.cnbcfm.com\/api\/v1\/image\/106855474-1616003500523Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-1-41-32-PM-png?v=1616004642&amp;w=740&amp;h=416\" alt=\"Mars House AR NFT\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mars House AR NFT<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The creation \u2014 called <strong>Mars House<\/strong> \u2014 is part of Kim\u2019s grand vision for the role augmented reality will play in the world, she explained in an interview on CNBC\u2019s\u00a0\u201cSquawk Alley.\u201d<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/03\/17\/creator-of-first-nft-digital-house-krista-kim-on-augmented-reality-.html\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/image.cnbcfm.com\/api\/v1\/image\/106855420-16160001341616000131-14827317178-1080pnbcnews.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"731\" height=\"411\" \/><\/a>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/03\/17\/creator-of-first-nft-digital-house-krista-kim-on-augmented-reality-.html\">Watch the full video interview with Krista Kim here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2021\/03\/06\/us\/tom-brady-rookie-card-sale-trnd\/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tom Brady&#8217;s rookie<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> card sold for over a million dollars. Cards, comics, action figures, and other collectibles are mass-produced. People want the original, not a reprint or copy. Collectibles are made on plastic or paper stock that is cheap, yet a person will spend millions for the correct item at the right time. Why?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People want to own what they consider a unique item. Until NFTs, there was no guarantee about the rarity of a unique digital item. That still didn&#8217;t stop people from spending big bucks on video games to get rare pieces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can guarantee that a specific item will always be unique, some collectors will go all-in on finding these pieces to add to their collection.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding a Balance\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There can be a downside to the uniqueness, though. If people feel like it is too expensive or too difficult to start or complete a collection, there is a chance that they will just walk away. It doesn\u2019t happen often but it has hurt specific collecting markets Playmates Star Trek action figures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid this, companies will have to find a balance between unique collectible items and availability to the general public. There are already things like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/eips.ethereum.org\/EIPS\/eip-1155#motivation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Semi-Fungible<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tokens being used to create this balance between desirability and availability.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR and NFTs Future\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR has been steadily growing since it was first introduced. What started as a fun idea has become one of the fastest-growing markets in technology. Players are just now getting used to an AR experience for many of their games.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these games, your characters can choose skins and emotes created by a community of AR enthusiasts. Right now, everyone gains access to the same costumes and skins with relative ease.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Augmented Reality and NFT certified uniqueness, people will have fun and spend a lot to get their favourite character, weapon, or outfit. As these become more accessible through systems like the Oculus and other AR-specific gaming options, you could see AR NFT collecting take-off.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the AR gets better, people will feel an even closer connection to their digital collection. Over time, there may be ways to add NFTs to all items and characters in AR to make them feel unique and connected to players.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&#8217;s Next?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NFTs aren&#8217;t going anywhere soon. As they become more popular, you will see more and more artists, companies, games, and AR games using them. People love unique items, and they love collecting them. Even just the appearance of rarity can make people want an item.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A guarantee of rarity may be a huge financial opportunity for AR developers and creators. Turning specific skins, armours, and items into personalized and unique pieces may lead to more interaction with the AR games.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox\" data-provider=\"facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vrvisioninc\/\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"Facebook\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/facebook.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-twitter nolightbox\" data-provider=\"twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/vrvisioninc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"twitter\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/twitter.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-linkedin nolightbox\" data-provider=\"linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/ca.linkedin.com\/company\/vr-vision-inc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"linkedin\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/linkedin.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-youtube nolightbox\" data-provider=\"youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" href=\"https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/channel\/UCc9hEJyEemiJe9DIOjBquhw\/videos\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px\"><img alt=\"youtube\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/youtube.png\" \/><\/a>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you came to this article, you probably aren&#8217;t just looking at alphabet soup in that title.
