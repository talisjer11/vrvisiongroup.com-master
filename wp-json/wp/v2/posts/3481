While business owners may set out to create the most highly polished and effective training plan, there is nothing that can replace the lessons and strategies that are learned from real, hands-on experience.<\/p>\n<p>Being able to understand how to navigate through the various complexities that are experienced on a daily basis is what makes employees shine \u2013 and it\u2019s what makes organizations stand out in their given industry.<\/p>\n<p>If you really want to ensure that your employees are truly prepped and ready to provide the most outstanding service possible, then you really need to consider following the examples set by some of the biggest and most successful industries and include the latest technologies into your training program: Virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and extended reality (XR).<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are VR, AR, and XR? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before we explain why virtual reality, augmented reality, and extended reality are so effective for training your employees, let\u2019s explain what each of these terms mean.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Virtual Reality. <\/em><\/strong>Virtual reality is a form of technology that provides a life-like 3D image or mock environment for users. It\u2019s created with a blend of interactive software (the programs) and hardware (the tools). When using virtual reality, users experience a simulation of reality, and this simulation is so vivid that it actually appears real.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Augmented Reality. <\/em><\/strong>This type of technology brings components of the virtual world into the real world. It improves what is seen, heard, and felt. Augmented reality utilizes the natural environment and adds virtual information over it, creating an environment where virtual and real world environments exist and work together (just like all of those fancy technologies Tony Stark uses in Iron Man.<\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Extended Reality. <\/em><\/strong>This is the a relatively new technology term. It combines both real and virtual worlds with human and computer interactions. Essentially, it\u2019s an umbrella type of reality, as it incorporates all aspects of virtual and augmented realities. Virtuality can range from being partially sensory to completely immersive.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Training and VR, AR, and XR<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now that you have a basic understanding of virtual reality, augmented reality, and extended reality, you are probably wondering how these forms of technology are being used in training.<\/p>\n<p>Basically, this type of training either places trainees into a simulated \u2013 yet seemingly real \u2013 environment, overlays their real environment with technology, or does a combination of both. For example, with virtual reality training, participants are provided with customized headsets that put them into a three-dimensional environment that replicate what they would experience in their real positions.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3489\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-3489\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-3489 size-large\" title=\"Offshore Crane Simulation\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Simulation-offshore-crane-bg-img-1024x480.jpg\" alt=\"Offshore Crane Simulation\" width=\"1024\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Simulation-offshore-crane-bg-img-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Simulation-offshore-crane-bg-img-300x141.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Simulation-offshore-crane-bg-img-768x360.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Simulation-offshore-crane-bg-img-437x205.jpg 437w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Simulation-offshore-crane-bg-img-400x188.jpg 400w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Simulation-offshore-crane-bg-img.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-3489\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Offshore Crane Simulation<\/p><\/div>\n<p>This type of training has been used for some time, but the use was limited and was really only available to big organizations. Now, thanks to the advent of technology, it\u2019s more affordable and easier to access, which means that organizations of all shapes and sizes and across all industries now have the ability to take advantage of the incredible benefits that AR, VR, and XR training provides.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Benefits of VR, AR, and XR Training<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The benefits that VR, AR, and XR training offer are quite obvious; however, to elaborate on the advantages, here\u2019s a look at some of the biggest perks your trainees will experience when you utilize this type of training, and in turn, the benefits your organization will be able to take advantage of.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reduced distractions. <\/strong>One of the major disadvantages of a traditional training program is distractions. No matter how advanced your program may be, there\u2019s really no way to completely eliminate distractions. For instance, if you offer a training seminar, participants can easily be distracted by almost anything. With virtual reality and augmented reality, those distractions are completely eliminated. That\u2019s because participants are fully engaged with their environment and the information that they are receiving. The less distracted they are, the more knowledge they retain, and the better prepared they will be.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A visual experience.<\/strong> The majority of people are visual learners. That\u2019s because more than 90 percent of the information that the brain receives is visually based. Virtual and augmented reality training presents information in a visually appealing, three-dimensional format, making the learning experience much more visual in nature. As a result, trainees are more likely to absorb and retain the information that they are presented with.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s more affordable. <\/strong>It used to be that virtual and augmented reality training was something that only corporations with extensive budgets or the military could take advantage of. That\u2019s because of the huge price tag that was attached to it. However, today, the advances in technology have made the software and hardware that are utilized with these types of realities much more affordable. In fact, this type of technology-based training can be significantly less expensive traditional training applications.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improved safety. <\/strong>Accidents related to training in the workplace are not uncommon. These accidents can lead to serious and even life-threatening injuries. Beginners are likely to make mistakes, and those mistakes can result in substantial damages. With VR and AR training, you can provide your new employees with a safe environment where they can receive hands-on training without the potential for accidents and injuries.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Remote training. <\/strong>Imagine being able to train new recruits without having to set aside designated training areas? Imagine how much easier it would be if you could completely train your new hires <em>before<\/em> they report for duty? With virtual reality and augmented reality training, your new employees can receive training anywhere, eliminating the need to allocated training locations, which can save you serious time and money.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>VR, AR, and XR Training are the Wave of the Future<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Given all of the benefits that this type of technologically advanced training provides, it\u2019s easy to see why so many organizations are using it to prep their new hires. VR, AR, and XR training are the wave of the future \u2013 and that future is here! Is your company ready to ride it?<\/p>\n<a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox\" data-provider=\"facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vrvisioninc\/\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"Facebook\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/facebook.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-twitter nolightbox\" data-provider=\"twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/vrvisioninc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"twitter\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/twitter.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-linkedin nolightbox\" data-provider=\"linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/ca.linkedin.com\/company\/vr-vision-inc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"linkedin\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/linkedin.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-youtube nolightbox\" data-provider=\"youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" href=\"https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/channel\/UCc9hEJyEemiJe9DIOjBquhw\/videos\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px\"><img alt=\"youtube\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/youtube.png\" \/><\/a>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>No matter the size or the industry, no business or organization can function and thrive without properly trained employees.
