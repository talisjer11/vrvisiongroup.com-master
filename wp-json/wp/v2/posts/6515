But while it\u2019s not new by any means, it can be applied to new and exciting directions \u2013 and the introduction of VR to renewable energy has a lot to bring to the table.<\/p>\n<p>It has the potential to take the sting out of the training cost almost entirely, and it can offer a level of interactivity never seen before.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how VR is being applied for renewable energy training, and just what this could mean.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Use VR At All<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Virtual reality opens up a world of possibility, especially in any sectors where training is involved; just some of the practical applications of VR for training can be seen through the medical industry, where operating on a patient in a virtually-aided situation becomes both cheaper to pull off, and safer for the \u201cpatient.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Much of the same reasons why VR is perfectly suited to the medical industry also applies to the use of <a href=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/virtual-reality-training\/\">VR for renewable energy training<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7wT3OVDD0e4?start=15\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>First, it offers a more cost-effective solution than what the majority of companies are doing right now. Where just the transport costs to on-site would have cost you thousands, the entire VR package will likely cost you less.<\/p>\n<p>VR also happens to be safer in many instances. Where one would normally have needed to visit the site, which isn\u2019t always a friendly commute when the turbines are still going up, you can now just log in and see almost everything you need to \u2013 without any of the associated risks.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are even more reasons why. It\u2019s a lot easier to match up with someone\u2019s schedule in an online environment rather than to meet them somewhere physical for a meeting, especially when we\u2019re talking about groups of people undergoing a training session or class together.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Showing a Real Scope<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Virtual reality allows us to see the real scope of a real product in a virtual environment. This allows one to see \u2013 and showcase \u2013 things that would have been pretty hard to do without the help of VR to do it. With virtual reality, the majority of the planning can be done away from the actual site, and with a lot more convenience.<\/p>\n<p>Visualization has always been a very powerful tool, and virtual reality offers the closest form of it that you can get.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YyPyZyUnhZg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>With virtual reality, the conditions surrounding the turbines can be adapted or introduced. For example, do you need to see how the wind turbines would behave in different wind conditions or a storm? You can do that with just a few clicks, and from there on you can make adaptations to your planning \u2013 or your training \u2013 based on the data you\u2019ve seen.<\/p>\n<p>It can tell you almost anything you\u2019d like to know about how renewable energy works in practice, and it\u2019s the closest you\u2019ll get to a large sandbox where you\u2019re allowed to experiment \u2013 and any teacher will know what kind of freedom this helps to give them in the classroom.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Converting Reality to Virtual Reality<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The transition from a real environment to a virtual one doesn\u2019t take nearly as much time or effort as you would think, nor does it have to cost thousands of dollars for you to do it. In fact, setting up a virtual environment could be a lot cheaper than having to cart your entire team of people over to the actual turbines \u2013 and with the use of VR, you aren\u2019t limited by anything like space, availability or any physical limitations of the people or the environment.\u00a0 This can be done with <a href=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/360-content-production\/\">360 video production<\/a> and the use of overlays to add interactivity to any given realistic scene.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Developmental Benefits of VR<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Virtual reality can be used for training at almost any chosen phase of the product where you need it, and it can be used to represent several different types of situations; this is freedom that physically going to the site can never give you just because of the fact that you can\u2019t alter circumstances in an offline world. But in the virtual one, it\u2019s limited only by your imagination.<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/E9N93zP85wc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Virtual reality has just as many possible benefits for the developmental phase, too. You can have your renewable energy solutions planned out and tested for practicality far before you\u2019ve even drawn a single line \u2013 and virtual reality can help you to see what you\u2019re building as you\u2019re doing it within a virtual environment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>VR Itself is Renewable<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Renewable energy solutions should always come from renewable energy in the first place; it\u2019s what keeps the entire cycle of sustainability going \u2013 and even in the field of training, a lot can be done to reduce the carbon footprint for just how much you\u2019re putting into the environment.<\/p>\n<p>The excellent thing about virtual reality is the fact that it&#8217;s renewable, too. Very little energy and resources are used when setting up a virtual environment than you would have used carting the training group there in a jet. It\u2019s this sustainability factor that\u2019s helped to make VR an even better choice for the future.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Groundbreaking Research Due to VR<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Virtual reality allows for research that would have been either impossible or wildly expensive without its use \u2013 and making research more accessible for companies will inevitably also have an effect on how easy newer, groundbreaking research will be to bring to the table in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Easier research means faster and better research at the same time. This means that the future of virtual reality looks even better than the present time \u2013 and a lot of new, groundbreaking research will no doubt be seen in the near future. We can thank VR for the ability to research renewable energy in real-time environments: Undeniably valuable and could change the face of the entire field.<\/p>\n<a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox\" data-provider=\"facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vrvisioninc\/\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"Facebook\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/facebook.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-twitter nolightbox\" data-provider=\"twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/vrvisioninc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"twitter\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/twitter.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-linkedin nolightbox\" data-provider=\"linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/ca.linkedin.com\/company\/vr-vision-inc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"linkedin\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/linkedin.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-youtube nolightbox\" data-provider=\"youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" href=\"https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/channel\/UCc9hEJyEemiJe9DIOjBquhw\/videos\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px\"><img alt=\"youtube\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/youtube.png\" \/><\/a>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Training is one of the most vital aspects of renewable energy solutions, although it\u2019s also true at the same time that specialized training such as this can cost you or your company thousands.
