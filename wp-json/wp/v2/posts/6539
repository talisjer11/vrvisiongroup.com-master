This is what makes it perfect to impress at the next trade show.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Here are 10 great examples of VR in practical use today.<\/strong><\/em><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Virtual Reality Games<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>People love games and the idea of instant interactivity \u2013 and once a crowd has gathered to check out other players, it quickly changes to an even bigger crowd, and your client base is instantly hooked to your idea and inspired to stay at your exhibition for longer. Showing the game-in-progress through a large screen can also help to bring in the crowd.<\/p>\n<p>Games are a great way to invite interactivity, and this is even better if the game you\u2019re showcasing can be related to your product in some way \u2013 but it still works even if the game <em>isn\u2019t<\/em> designed specifically for you.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Live Interviews<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The social aspects of virtual reality can\u2019t be underestimated, and live interviews as well as conference calls can be set up with the help of virtual reality for demonstration purposes. It even makes the possibility of a \u201cmeet-and-greet\u201d with a celebrity host or famous guest a lot easier for both sides \u2013 and it allows for virtual-reality aided interaction that you\u2019d be hard pressed to find somewhere else.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of a virtual reality meet-up is often easier to set up than a physical meeting \u2013 and a lot cheaper \u2013 and offers an impressive level of virtual interaction that\u2019s much easier to manage.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Adrenaline Demonstrations<\/strong><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Sometimes people want more than just your average virtual reality experience, and for these types of people, VR can still be used to create an experience that\u2019s high on the interactivity scale \u2013 and a massive adrenaline rush. One of the top benefits of virtual reality is the fact that it can put people in situations they would never have been able to experience outside of this context \u2013 and this gives you a lot of potential for demonstrations where people want to be thrilled.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Virtual Tours<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Virtual tours can be great for inviting interactivity, and virtual reality can make your chosen crowd feel like they\u2019re immersed right in the middle of the environment. Done with the help of VR, you can imagine your virtual tour to be something like Google Earth or Street View, but instead with your chosen location or setting as the scene; it can be anywhere and anything, and it\u2019s even better if you can relate the virtual tour to your product or service \u2013 for example, by giving viewers a tour of your manufacturing environment.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Product Demonstrations<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you have a specific product that you\u2019d like to have at your show, virtual reality gives you an excellent way to blend interaction with your product in a way that impresses from the start. Virtual reality is already something new and exciting to most, and blended with your product, this can help to make people feel a lot more excited about what you\u2019re selling \u2013 and a virtual environment allows you to showcase what it can really do.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong> Virtual Travel<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Virtual travel is turning into a larger and larger industry, and taking a participant to a new virtual location can be a great way to get them to stick around for a little bit longer; the possibilities for virtual travel are incredible, and you can take viewers to anywhere in the world \u2013 even to the inside of a factory a few thousand miles away \u2013 in the blink of an eye. Virtual travel can even be blended with other techniques, like VR games, to create a more immersive experience.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong> Immersive Charity<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Charity opportunities are too often missed when it comes to trade shows. With companies needing to put more focus on their corporate responsibility, immersive charity can be an excellent way to involve viewers in someone else\u2019s world \u2013 and just how you involve your viewer in this world is up to you, depending on the type of environment that you need to showcase to make an impact. You can take the viewer anywhere in the world, and this has a lot of potential \u2013 especially for grabbing the right kind of attention during a trade show.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong> The Unique Experience<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Want to give people an even more unique experience? You can set up a virtual reality booth that lets people sit down in serious luxury with the full virtual-reality experience \u2013 and you can combine this unique \u201cbooth\u201d experience with any of the other VR methods on this list and it should work each time. This gives people a more personal feel when they end up at your part of the trade show, and it can help to hook people towards being interested in your product.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong> The Big Touch Screen<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>People like flashiness, and people love interactivity: A successful booth at a trade show looks at combining these elements in order to hook customers and get them interested in your product. Immersive reality allows you to play around with the level of user interactivity \u2013 and you can easily set up a huge touch screen that allows people to be even more interactive when it comes to your product. While it doesn\u2019t seem like it can make as much of a difference, you\u2019d be surprised at just how much of a difference it can make in getting people to stick around.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong> More VR Interaction<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Virtual reality can be used to great effect when pushing the interactive aspects of your product at a trade show, and you can use any number of combinations of the other nine items on this list to achieve the effect you need. For more VR interaction, you can create an entire platform where users can participate in situations that showcase what your product can do \u2013 whether you\u2019re using a big touch screen or a few sets of VR goggles to achieve this goal.<\/p>\n<a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook
