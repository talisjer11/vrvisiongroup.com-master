Virtual reality, in particular, has changed the entire trade show landscape. It gives companies the opportunity to really put their products front-and-center, make them more appealing, and captures the attention of consumers at an astounding level.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual reality leaves a lasting impression on consumers. It allows companies to paint a clear picture of their mission and really lets them convey their message. It attracts people, makes them want to learn more, and can really help to enhance brand recognition and establish authority. Add a virtual reality angle to your next trade show, and it\u2019s almost guaranteed that you will have a huge crowd assembled in front of your booth in no time.<\/p>\n<p>Given all the benefits that it provides, virtual reality is quickly becoming the new standard for trade shows. If you\u2019re interested in incorporating VR into your next trade show, but have no idea how to go about using it, here are some suggestions that can help turn the visitors to your booth into clients.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/the-definitive-guide-to-using-virtual-reality-at-events-and-conferences\/\">Check out our Definitive Guide to Using VR for Events &amp; Conferences Here<br \/>\n<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/>\nCreate a Virtual Reality Showroom<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Imagine if you could bring your entire showroom with you to a trade show? Of course, it\u2019s impossible to pack up everything you have at your facility and display it in a booth\u2026 or is it?<\/p>\n<p>With virtual reality, you can showcase your entire showroom. VR gives you limitless square footage, so you can really show off all of the products that consumers can find when they visit your establishment. For example, if you sell furniture, you only have a limited amount of space in your booth, which only allows you to showcase a few of your pieces. If you use VR, you can show all the furnishings in your showroom: beds, recliners, couches, dining tables, and more! Your booth visitors can have an up-close, personal, and interactive experience with your furniture. They can even try them out! With VR, you have the ability to really show what your company offers at trade shows. When consumers can interact with and see all of your products, there\u2019s a much better chance that they will make a purchase.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Offer Hands-On Training<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you offer products that are best demonstrated when people actually use them and receive hands-on training, then <a href=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/custom-build-vr-application-experience-development\/\">virtual reality<\/a> is the way to go.<\/p>\n<p>Through VR, you can give your trade show booth visitors immediate hands-on training right on the floor of the trade show. If you sell highly complex machinery, for example, you can give prospective buyers the training that they need to use your products with virtual reality. You\u2019ll instill a great sense of confidence in your products and in your booth visitors and increase the chances that they will place an order.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Share Your Story<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Trade shows are abuzz with tons of activity. With so many companies vying for the attention of consumers, it can be easy to get lost in the shuffle. Virtual reality is a great way to cut through all of the commotion, capture the attention of booth visitors, reduce distractions, and really tell your story.<\/p>\n<p>Through VR, trade show goers can be transported into another dimension \u2013 a dimension that tells the story about your business. They\u2019ll be completely submerged in the videos, graphics, and audio you\u2019re displaying, so you won\u2019t have to worry about losing their attention to the buzzing lights and sounds coming from the trade show floor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Give a Virtual Tour<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you want to achieve as much success as possible at a trade show, you really need to differentiate yourself. There are going to be dozens of booths operated by companies that offer products that are very similar to yours. It\u2019s easy for attendees to get overwhelmed or distracted and overlook the uniqueness of your company.<\/p>\n<p>If you really want to stand out from the crowd, use virtual reality to give your booth visitors a tour of your facility. Let\u2019s say you own a winery and you\u2019re showcasing your products at a trade show. It\u2019s safe to say that there are going to be dozens of other wineries there, too, and they \u2013 like you \u2013 are trying to make capture the attention of the crowd. Sure, you can offer free samples, host raffles, and explain the unique processes you use to make your wine; however, every other winery you are up against will be doing the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>What if you could transport trade show visitors to your winery and let them actually see your process? With virtual reality, you can! Show them your land, your grapes, your harvesting practices, your barreling procedures, and every other element that goes into creating your wine. You\u2019ll definitely set yourself apart from the crowd, leave a lasting impression, and score more sales.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting the Most Out of the Virtual Reality Experience<\/h2>\n<p>The above are all excellent ways to <em>incorporate virtual reality into your trade show<\/em>; however, if you really want to make the experience a success, you\u2019re going to want to keep a few things in mind.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some suggestions that can help ensure the success of your VR trade show:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establish your goal. Doing so will determine what type of VR experience you want to create and share with your visitors.<\/li>\n<li>Comfort is key! Don\u2019t pack your VR show with too much action or you could overwhelm your visitors. Avoid including motions that are too quick, having objects positioned too close to their faces, or including experiences that are highly intense or even scary.<\/li>\n<li>Time it right. VR is intended to attract people and get them interested, but it shouldn\u2019t be your entire presentation. Make your demo short \u2013 5 minutes or less \u2013 to keep things moving and to give you the opportunity to interact with your audience.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pick a reputable VR agency or developer<\/strong>. Look for a company that has <a href=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/use-cases\/\">extensive experience<\/a>, has a proven track record of success, and is willing to work with you to develop the <a href=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/virtual-reality-development\/\">exact experience<\/a> you are looking to create.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox\" data-provider=\"facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vrvisioninc\/\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"Facebook\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/facebook.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-twitter nolightbox\" data-provider=\"twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/vrvisioninc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"twitter\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/twitter.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-linkedin nolightbox\" data-provider=\"linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/ca.linkedin.com\/company\/vr-vision-inc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"linkedin\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/linkedin.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-youtube nolightbox\" data-provider=\"youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" href=\"https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/channel\/UCc9hEJyEemiJe9DIOjBquhw\/videos\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px\"><img alt=\"youtube\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/youtube.png\" \/><\/a>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thanks to the advent of certain types of technology, trade shows have certainly come a long way.
