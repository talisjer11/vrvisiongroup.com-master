But today VR is more affordable, available and useful than ever before. Using just a smartphone and cardboard headset device, anyone can access a virtual reality experience.<\/p>\n<p>While VR is fun and entertaining, it\u2019s also good for business. No matter what type of product or service you provide, virtual reality can help you reach potential customers, improve site traffic and increase conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at five simple, effective ways VR can help your brand:<\/p>\n<h2>Training<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"590\" height=\"393\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2472\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/image.jpg\" alt=\"vr-training\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/image.jpg 590w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/image-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/image-338x225.jpg 338w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/image-400x266.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/><br \/>\nVirtual Reality is an increasingly effective way to train people in situations which would otherwise be very dangerous, expensive or otherwise impractical. In the medical field, surgeons can use VR to train for procedures; nurses can learn how to find a vein and other medical professionals can learn skills without having to practice on an actual patient.<\/p>\n<p>Learning to operate complicated machinery such as a truck or airplane is another situation where VR training can be a big benefit. Before the popularity of smartphone-based virtual reality, aspiring pilots had to train in large flight simulators located in specific locations. Now people can learn complicated tasks from anywhere as long as they have a smartphone, VR headset, and the right training apps.<\/p>\n<h2>Real Estate<\/h2>\n<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"407\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2474\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/virtual-reality-and-real-estate.jpg\" alt=\"real\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/virtual-reality-and-real-estate.jpg 640w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/virtual-reality-and-real-estate-300x191.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/virtual-reality-and-real-estate-354x225.jpg 354w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/virtual-reality-and-real-estate-400x254.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/>\n<p>Sometimes touring a home in person can be logistically difficult. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/02\/14\/realestate\/virtual-reality-to-sell-homes.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Real estate professionals are increasingly turning to VR tours<\/a>. This lets potential buyers check out a house with no physical travel required.<\/p>\n<p>Setting up the virtual tour requires two steps. First, the real estate professional must film the home for sale. They\u2019ll capture every aspect of the house from the front door all the way to the back yard. Then potential buyers can tour the house virtually. Even better, they can take the virtual tour from anywhere and at any time. Virtual tours are also a lot easier on the seller\u2019s schedule, too.<\/p>\n<h2>Therapy<\/h2>\n<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"590\" height=\"335\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2475\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/virtual-reality-therapy.jpg\" alt=\"vrv\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/virtual-reality-therapy.jpg 590w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/virtual-reality-therapy-300x170.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/virtual-reality-therapy-396x225.jpg 396w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/virtual-reality-therapy-400x227.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" \/>\n<p>Immersion therapy is a well-established method to help people overcome phobias, anxieties and other issues. This type of therapy involves exposing the person to their fears in a controlled environment. For instance, if someone is afraid of dogs, the therapist will gently and safely introduce a dog to the patient. The idea is to slowly build comfort with whatever the patient fears.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual reality allows for safe immersion in otherwise dangerous environments. Using a simple VR setup, patients can experience virtual heights, crowds or other anxiety-provoking situations. With the therapist\u2019s guidance, patients have a safe setting where they can learn to manage their fears. If the session ever becomes too intense, the patient can \u201cescape\u201d at any time by simply removing their VR headset.<\/p>\n<h2>Continuing Education<\/h2>\n<p>Many companies offer additional training opportunities for their employees. Virtual reality is a great addition to many in-office training programs. Employees are able to fully immerse themselves in subject to a degree not found in any other type of instruction.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual reality is a fun, fascinating way to learn. A VR session is often more engaging than a traditional textbook or lecture. In some cases, a virtual classroom can be created where students across multiple locations can meet and share an online space.<\/p>\n<p>VR also allows for easy group training. Trainees can all \u201cmeet\u201d virtually for an instructor-guided course. Location and logistical problems are easily solved when everyone can connect online.<\/p>\n<h2>Advertising<\/h2>\n<p>Virtual reality is entertaining. Almost any product or service can be packaged into a VR experience and sold as entertainment. If you sell a product or service which is visually interesting, you can showcase the experience in virtual reality.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-19\/how-oculus-and-cardboard-are-going-to-rock-the-travel-industry\" rel=\"nofollow\">the travel industry can often make excellent use of VR<\/a>. Potential customers can use a VR headset to take a virtual tour of a distant location. When the customer can actually see themselves in some exotic locale, they\u2019re far more likely to book a trip.<\/p>\n<p>But really any business can benefit from VR. You can use virtual reality to take potential customers on a behind-the-scenes tour of your office or workplace. This helps create a personal connection between customers and your brand.<\/p>\n<h2>Virtual Reality for Business<\/h2>\n<p>VR headsets are cheap and available. But virtual reality isn\u2019t currently a \u201cmust have\u201d for every business plan. That\u2019s actually great news! If you start developing a VR strategy today, your business will have a serious advantage over the competition.<\/p>\n<p>Make no mistake: Virtual reality isn\u2019t a fad. Much like smart devices, VR is going to fundamentally alter the worlds of business and marketing.<\/p>\n<h2>Developing a VR Plan<\/h2>\n<p>The first step towards developing a virtual reality plan is actually fairly low-tech. You need to understand who your customers are and what problem they want to be solved. Virtual reality is really just a tool. In order to connect with your customers, you\u2019ll need to create VR programs which they\u2019ll respond to.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual reality for businesses has tons of potential. Whether you sell a physical product, virtual service or something else entirely, a virtual experience can boost brand awareness and conversions. <a href=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/\">VR software<\/a> will soon impact the business world in a big way \u2013 is your business ready?<\/p>\n<a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox\" data-provider=\"facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vrvisioninc\/\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"Facebook\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/facebook.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-twitter nolightbox\" data-provider=\"twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/vrvisioninc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"twitter\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/twitter.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-linkedin nolightbox\" data-provider=\"linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/ca.linkedin.com\/company\/vr-vision-inc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"linkedin\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/linkedin.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-youtube nolightbox\" data-provider=\"youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" href=\"https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/channel\/UCc9hEJyEemiJe9DIOjBquhw\/videos\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px\"><img alt=\"youtube\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/youtube.png\" \/><\/a>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Even just a few years ago, the idea of virtual reality was more at home in the realm of science fiction than the real world of business.
