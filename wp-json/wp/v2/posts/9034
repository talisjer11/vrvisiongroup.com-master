I won\u2019t go into an in-depth comparison of the devices and companies but will give a brief description of my personal and company experience in using both. Keep in mind that Meta Quest invests more in R&amp;D a year than the combined market cap of both key competitors. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">That said they do share a lot of advantages and disadvantages, both offer incredible B2B Sales, Marketing, and Technical support for both clients and ISVs. Both struggled at times with precision tracking (the Pico more than the Focus) causing some lag, even in low poly scenes. Both are much more expensive than the Quest 2. They also have a more open platform that allows developers to be more creative with their applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-9049 aligncenter\" title=\"headsets-compared\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/headsets-compared-960x319.jpg\" alt=\"vr-headsets-compared\" width=\"960\" height=\"319\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/headsets-compared-960x319.jpg 960w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/headsets-compared-300x100.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/headsets-compared-768x255.jpg 768w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/headsets-compared-437x145.jpg 437w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/headsets-compared-400x133.jpg 400w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/headsets-compared.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Both companies have an incredible opportunity to secure and dominate market share. To do this the only thing they can do within such a tight time frame is to aggressively cut costs &#8211; support the ISV community and organizations developing their apps to migrate over to their hardware. It may be done at a loss, but the opportunity for no supply from their key competitor will likely not repeat itself anytime soon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There is an opportunity for companies such as Samsung, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Microsoft, and others to enter the space and try to get a foothold before Meta Quest returns &#8211; it\u2019s probably the best time to make a move and gain a foothold with their massive client base.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Existing Meta Quest Clients<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You\u2019re an existing client for Meta Quest, what are your options now?

Although, discontinuing OFB before a replacement was put in place shows a serious lack of competence and foresight from their business leaders. Their privacy policy needs to become more transparent around user data collection. They need to start acting like a true B2B company by assigning manpower to client &amp; partner management. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Although their biggest threat in the future is if a company like Microsoft or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/apple-glasses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple<\/a> decides to go after their B2B VR Market. With their already established cloud dominance, Office\/Windows\/iCloud\/iPhone monopolies &amp; established salesforce they would see little competition &#8211; even if their device is just a
