The days when it was just something that we saw in movies and TV are over. It has almost completely taken over the gaming market. It is quickly becoming a large part of safety training for jobs of all types.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The traditional way of training employees to deal with a dangerous situation that could arise is no longer enough. It is too difficult to show someone the changing variables that can take place in a tense situation.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Traditional Safety Training<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of jobs where safety is crucial. Police officers, firefighters, construction workers, and pilots are only a few that could have dire consequences if safety is not a top priority.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safety training was traditionally done in a classroom. Different scenarios are brought up and discussed to identify the best solutions for each one. Hands-on training can look a lot different depending on what kind of job you are doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Police officers have obstacle courses and firing ranges to simulate conditions in the field.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firefighters have towers that they climb, and they go into smoking buildings or houses having a controlled burn.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pilots can get into a cockpit simulator to practice their instrument training.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of these forms of safety training are more effective than others. But all of them have serious drawbacks. Mostly, they are limited.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can only go through an obstacle course once before it becomes familiar. You cannot change the layout. You can do them over and over. But with there being no way to change them, they can become monotonous and lose their effectiveness.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Reasons Why VR Safety Training Is Better<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are inherent dangers and feasibility problems with the traditional way safety training happens. It comes down to the fact that the way it has always been done is the only way to do it. Companies make the best of it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the things that we do for safety training are dangerous in and of themselves. To send firefighters into an actual fire to train them and have police officers fire at moving targets is risky. But since it was the only way to teach them, that is how they did it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that Virtual Reality technology has come so far, a whole new dynamic is opening up. There are many reasons why <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/virtual-reality-training\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual Reality training<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is better for workers than the old way.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Safer Environment<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual Reality takes all the danger out of any environment. It can get you close to feeling like you are there without putting you in harm\u2019s way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A police academy student can go into a nearly life-like scenario that they could face in their career. They can confront all sorts of dangers. And the next time that they run through it, they could face all-new encounters. The whole setting could even be changed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A firefighter could train to retrieve a child from a house fire without facing the dangers of actual flames. You never have to worry about smoke inhalation or overexertion. No buildings will collapse, and no one will get seriously hurt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electricians can practice<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> their trade without the risk of electrocution. Rescue workers can practice HAZMAT protocols without being exposed to dangerous chemicals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Different Scenarios<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditional training is limited in what scenarios you can train. A firefighter can train in a house fire, but not in a high rise at the same time. You can\u2019t physically burn a house and then drive to another part of town to simulate a high-rise fire.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with Virtual Reality, you can train them on their duties in the house fire and then switch over and do the high-rise or a water rescue on the same day. The scenarios change, which forces the trainee to use a different part of his mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=v13qs0mDBMI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">keeps workers from getting complacent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in their training. They retain more of what they learned in the classroom because they find more hands-on ways to use that knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Endless Repetition<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some training, the only way to master it is to do it repeatedly. Virtual reality training for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forconstructionpros.com\/business\/construction-safety\/blog\/21000365\/can-virtual-reality-make-construction-safer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">construction workers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can take advantage of the value of repetition. A worker on the fiftieth floor of an unfinished skyscraper can virtually do that job repeatedly until it is second nature.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working with virtual tools, putting on safety equipment, and going through procedures and protocols many times will make them retain more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even surgeons preparing for a delicate operation can benefit from the repetition offered by Virtual Reality. They can perform that surgery a hundred times until they are flawless before doing it in real life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Immersion Training Increases Focus<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A pilot going through training will sit in a cockpit simulator staring at instruments. While being able to fly by instruments is very important, the feeling of being in a fake cockpit in a classroom makes it hard to focus on something like that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immersing yourself in a virtual world with all the sites and sounds that make it really helps to learn that much quicker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking through the window and seeing the obstruction you are trying to avoid or seeing the position of the ground to the sky makes it more realistic. The realistic surroundings help to draw the trainee into the situation. That helps them maintain their composure and figure out what they need to do.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Insights<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual Reality safety training does not just send a trainee into a situation and grade them on how they handle it. It can monitor everything about them and how they react.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their eyes can be tracked. What were they looking at? Did they notice a hazard when it presented itself, or did they take a minute?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The heart rate can be gauged. Are they panicking in high-stress situations?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Listening can be measured. Are they hearing warning signs? Are they reacting to threats that haven\u2019t presented themselves yet?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these things can help with their training, but they can also help with developing the software. If dangers aren\u2019t making themselves known, then the simulation can be adjusted.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of training that can be accomplished by traditional means is impressive. We\u2019ve been able to create some fine first responders and soldiers using the old way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But virtual reality training is allowing companies to make the training better than it has ever been, all while saving a lot of money and potential incidents in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox\" data-provider=\"facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vrvisioninc\/\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"Facebook\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/facebook.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-twitter nolightbox\" data-provider=\"twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/vrvisioninc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"twitter\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/twitter.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-linkedin nolightbox\" data-provider=\"linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/ca.linkedin.com\/company\/vr-vision-inc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"linkedin\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/linkedin.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-youtube nolightbox\" data-provider=\"youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" href=\"https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/channel\/UCc9hEJyEemiJe9DIOjBquhw\/videos\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px\"><img alt=\"youtube\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/youtube.png\" \/><\/a>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Virtual Reality technology is advancing exponentially.
