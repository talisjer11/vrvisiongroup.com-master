It\u2019s not a new technology by any means, and it\u2019s been around for at least 100 years prior to this moment \u2013 but it\u2019s never quite been applied to the development of Virtual Reality quite like now, and we\u2019re seeing great leaps and bounds in technology and the way people are immersed in their virtual worlds.<\/p>\n<p>Virtual Reality becomes pretty useless to the user when it isn\u2019t an immersive experience, and the burden falls on the developers of VR hardware and software to ensure that the experience is as close to real-life as possible. It has to make you feel like you\u2019re right in the middle of what you\u2019re looking at \u2013 and it\u2019s not enough to be looking at a scene through VR glasses when you want the full experience.<\/p>\n<p><em>True<\/em> immersion for Virtual Reality involves being able to engage all of the senses at once \u2013 sight, smell, taste, touch and sound; though we know that taste and smell aren\u2019t nearly as necessary for VR to work as the rest.\u00a0 Could we go as far as to say that the senses required for VR immersion is sight, touch and sound?<\/p>\n<p>How do you judge whether or not something is real? In the first Matrix movie, Morpheus asks Neo if what he can smell, taste or touch is real \u2013 and then goes on to show him that the construct of \u201creal\u201d he had known was just about fooling these human senses with computerization.<\/p>\n<p>While we haven\u2019t blacked out the sun yet like in the heavily Dystopian tone of the Matrix movies, the movie got the idea of Virtual Reality pretty spot on. If you\u2019re going to fool anyone into thinking it\u2019s real, fool the senses.<\/p>\n<p>To believe that you\u2019re truly immersed in your virtual reality experience, sound and how you experience it is one of the most important parts of the whole VR thrill.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4471\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4471\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4471 size-full\" title=\"spatial-audio\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/spatial-audio.png\" alt=\"vr-spatial-audio\" width=\"800\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/spatial-audio.png 800w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/spatial-audio-300x128.png 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/spatial-audio-768x326.png 768w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/spatial-audio-437x186.png 437w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/spatial-audio-400x170.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-4471\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Example of how Spatial Audio is received.<\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>Reacting to Sound<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sound activates a primal reaction within the brain, and sound is often the very first way we react to something; for example, while you\u2019re playing a first person shooter, you\u2019ll be paying the most attention to the sound to find the position of the opposing player \u2013 on the other hand, while immersed in a VR movie, your mind will pay the most attention to the sound to associate both the sound and the visual aspects with each other.<\/p>\n<p>To put it in its most simple terms, the brain asks itself three questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What am I seeing?<\/li>\n<li>What am I hearing?<\/li>\n<li>Do these two things match up?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The first two questions should be answered by the VR experience already \u2013 and if one of the first two questions <em>aren\u2019t<\/em> immersive enough to the user then the brain\u2019s answer to the third (more important) question that tells your brain how immersed it is (or not) will be a simple no.<\/p>\n<p>We already have the visual aspects of virtual reality developed to a much more advanced degree than some years ago: Virtual Reality goggles are becoming cheaper and easier to access; projects like Google Cardboard have even made experimentation with VR easier.<\/p>\n<p>But when it comes to developing the sound aspects that fit with the visuals, fully immersive spatial audio <em>could<\/em> be the answer to finally providing the perfect VR experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Regular Audio Isn\u2019t Enough<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you want a practical example of why regular audio isn\u2019t enough for real VR immersion, then you\u2019re going to need to do a little experiment. You can use even the cheapest headphones for this.<\/p>\n<p>There are many songs that illustrate the concept of stereo practically so that you can hear why it matters: Many classics by the Grateful Dead or Led Zeppelin use effects that seem to \u201cbounce\u201d between one headphone to another. <em>This<\/em> effect is the stereo effect \u2013 and it sounds pretty damn cool, especially through the right quality headphones.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s not all it is: It\u2019s also something very important to your brain.<\/p>\n<p>Audio tells you where things are. If you were to close your eyes and listen, your brain relies on the position of sound to form a clearer picture \u2013 and the same applies to VR, when your visual input is being replaced with a picture seen on a VR screen.<\/p>\n<p>In order for your brain to be truly immersed in the VR experience, your brain needs to be able to relate to 3-dimensional sound \u2013 sound that tells you more about the environment you\u2019re in, which is (in this case) a virtual one.<\/p>\n<p>If the audio is off, your brain will notice that something is \u201cwrong\u201d and it just won\u2019t sound right.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When It \u201cDoesn\u2019t Sound Right\u201d <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When things around you don\u2019t sound quite \u201cright\u201d to your brain like we\u2019ve just explained above, your brain automatically assumes that there\u2019s something wrong with the entire environment \u2013 and the whole VR setup starts to disappear for your brain, much like the glitch in the Matrix when the cat appears twice.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt means they\u2019ve changed something.\u201d Your brain <em>knows<\/em> something is wrong when the audio doesn\u2019t match, when it doesn\u2019t truly immerse you in what you\u2019re seeing \u2013 but when your brain trusts the two inputs fully, then it tends to trust the entire concept of immersion more.<\/p>\n<p>You <em>can<\/em> fool your brain into experiencing a fuller virtual reality world \u2013 but only if you use sound immersion <em>right. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What the Hell is Fully Immersive Spatial Audio? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fully Immersive Spatial Audio isn\u2019t a \u201cnew\u201d technology by any means; it\u2019s something sound engineers have known about for decades \u2013 but we\u2019re seeing more and more reason to use this technology within VR because it offers a far more \u201cfull-bodied\u201d sound experience that gets us a little closer to experience real virtual reality.<\/p>\n<p>Fully immersive spatial audio makes use of several different techniques in order to round off the sound experience, turning it into a truly 3D sound experience that \u201cpositions\u201d different sounds in the room \u2013 or virtual environment \u2013 so that your brain forms a much fuller image.<\/p>\n<p>There are many techniques used in the development of fully immersive spatial audio, including the use of heightened speakers that add an element never-before-seen in speaker systems: Height.<\/p>\n<p>Think about your average \u201csurround sound\u201d system \u2013 it surrounded the viewer as much as it possibly could, but one of the elements that was very rarely accurately added was <em>height<\/em>: Sure, you could tell that a sound was coming from one side or another, but you couldn\u2019t tell the finer details like how close to the floor this sound might have been.<\/p>\n<p>Are you starting to see the difference between simple surround sound and fully immersive spatial audio?<\/p>\n<p>Fully immersive spatial audio offers three dimensions, and space to sound where you previously wouldn\u2019t have had such a deeply immersive experience: It offers height, depth, reality: The real elements that you\u2019re looking for when we\u2019re talking about VR.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Immersive Sound and Training Developers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The applications of immersive sound for achieving real reality within VR are immense \u2013 and it also opens up a whole new world of opportunity for both sound engineers and developers, who might have to explore the field of immersive sound more in the form of workshops.<\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of workshops (and them some) that explain the basics of immersive sound, how it works and how they can apply practical techniques to their sound recording (and playback) to ensure for a better sound experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scaling Through Sound<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sound tells you everything you need to know about your immediate environment, and spatial immersive sound attempts to fill in all of the gaps that your brain needs to know about the essential elements.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where am I in relation to the sound?<\/li>\n<li>How far is the sound from my immediate position?<\/li>\n<li>How <em>high<\/em> or <em>low <\/em>is the sound?<\/li>\n<li>What\u2019s the <em>distance<\/em> of the sound?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your brain doesn\u2019t receive a 3D answer about these questions \u2013 one that positions the brai, the sound and the environment all at once \u2013 then the experience just can\u2019t be called immersive enough to be called real Virtual Reality.<\/p>\n<p>The importance of fully immersive spatial audio can\u2019t be underestimated for anyone who needs to have the fully immersive experience. If you want to fool the brain completely, it turns out that you have to fool the right senses at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-facebook nolightbox\" data-provider=\"facebook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vrvisioninc\/\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"Facebook\" title=\"Follow us on Facebook\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/facebook.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-twitter nolightbox\" data-provider=\"twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/vrvisioninc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"twitter\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/twitter.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-linkedin nolightbox\" data-provider=\"linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" href=\"https:\/\/ca.linkedin.com\/company\/vr-vision-inc\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px;margin-right:5px\"><img alt=\"linkedin\" title=\"Find us on Linkedin\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/linkedin.png\" \/><\/a><a class=\"synved-social-button synved-social-button-follow synved-social-size-48 synved-social-resolution-single synved-social-provider-youtube nolightbox\" data-provider=\"youtube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" href=\"https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/channel\/UCc9hEJyEemiJe9DIOjBquhw\/videos\" style=\"font-size: 0px;width:48px;height:48px;margin:0;margin-bottom:5px\"><img alt=\"youtube\" title=\"Find us on YouTube\" class=\"synved-share-image synved-social-image synved-social-image-follow\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\" style=\"display: inline;width:48px;height:48px;margin: 0;padding: 0;border: none\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/social-media-feather\/synved-social\/addons\/extra-icons\/image\/social\/circle\/96x96\/youtube.png\" \/><\/a>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fully Immersive Spatial Audio has the potential to change the face of the VR industry as we know it.
