With so much uncertainty in the world right now, it makes a lot more sense for brands to start using virtual reality for remote training.\u00a0 Sure there is the current status quo way of conducting remote work, using things like Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts, or even Zoom meetings.\u00a0 But we all know the effectiveness of these platforms is limited and can sometimes cause miscommunications.<\/p>\n<p>Many times internally here at VR Vision, we&#8217;ve had meetings drop, connectivity issues, and trouble conducting live demonstrations of our products.\u00a0 Back two years ago many predicted that we would have virtual reality in the workplace and that &#8220;virtual meetings&#8221; would be the next thing.\u00a0 Here we are today in one of the deadliest epidemics to ever grace our planet, and yet where are the VR meetings?<\/p>\n<p>As businesses look to go remote over the course of the next few weeks (or months?), can virtual reality be used in an effective way to conduct business?\u00a0 Collaborative white-boards and virtual conference rooms, all with customized avatars of users connected, seem like a good idea no? Yes and no.\u00a0 While the problem herein lies within the adoption of the technology.\u00a0 Not all brands have adopted VR, and not every company has disposable Oculus Quests for their employees to take home.\u00a0 Then comes the problem of programming; you would need some kind of virtual environment platform to host the meetings.<\/p>\n<h3>Virtual Reality Platforms for Collaboration<\/h3>\n<p>Currently, there are two candidates for virtual collaboration in VR.\u00a0 Engage and Glue.\u00a0 Both have their benefits and drawbacks and I&#8217;ll look at the features of each below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Engage VR &#8211;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/engagevr.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/engagevr.io\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Engage is fully encompassing training and education platforms in virtual reality.\u00a0 It allows educators to host meetings, presentations, classes and events with people anywhere in the world.\u00a0 Engage allows for up to 50 remote users to be connected in their environments at the same time and has over 20 virtual locations that are unique environments for hosting your next town hall.<\/p>\n<p>The platform offers over 1200 3D objects that you can utilize in their environments as well as a media streaming component that will allow users to share all types of media &#8212; from 360 videos to integrated web browsing and desktop sharing.\u00a0 They offer a recorder feature to create content presentation style, as well as quizzes and forms that can be interactive with users on the platform.<\/p>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7870 alignnone\" title=\"Engage-VR\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Image-courtesy-Engage.2-622x350-1.jpg\" alt=\"Engage-VR\" width=\"622\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Image-courtesy-Engage.2-622x350-1.jpg 622w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Image-courtesy-Engage.2-622x350-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Image-courtesy-Engage.2-622x350-1-400x225.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" \/>\n<p><strong>Glue Platform &#8211;<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/glue.work\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/glue.work\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Glue, on the other hand, is a collaboration platform that has a much higher quality graphic aesthetic.\u00a0 They feature a toolkit that enables 3D avatars, spatial audio and unique spaces built to enhance collaborative meetings and allow for teams to brainstorm, co-create, annotate, take notes and facilitate meetings all within virtual spaces.\u00a0 There are additional tools like whiteboards, post-it notes, 3D model importing and freehand 3D drawing all to allow for virtual team building.<\/p>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7871 alignnone\" title=\"glue\" src=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/960x0-300x161.png\" alt=\"glue\" width=\"622\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/960x0-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/960x0-768x413.png 768w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/960x0-419x225.png 419w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/960x0-400x215.png 400w, https:\/\/vrvisiongroup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/960x0.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" \/>\n<p><em><strong>But what if I want to have a remote training solution for enhancing process training?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>With modern standalone headsets, you are now able to use them to create real-world replicated environments that can be used for remote worker training.
